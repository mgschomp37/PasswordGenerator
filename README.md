## Password Generator GUI
Simple password generator with Python

#

 This password generator:
- Takes any number of words provided from the words.txt file of 4-5 letter words and puts them together
- Goes through the newly created string randomly capitalizing letters
- Goes through a preset list of special character substitutions to change letters into characters (i.e 'a' -> '@')
- Adds a random number to the end of the password
- Uses PySimpleGui for a simple graphic for generating a password
